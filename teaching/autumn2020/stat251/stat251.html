      <h4><b>Overview and prerequisites</b></h4>

      <p>This course covers fundamentals and axioms; combinatorial probability; conditional probability
	and independence; binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions; the law of large numbers and the central
	limit theorem; and random variables and generating functions.</p>

      <p>One of the following courses is a prequisite for this course:
	<ul>
	  <li>Math 16300, Math 16310, Math 20500, Math 20510, or Math 20900, with no grade requirement</li>
	  <li>Math 19520 or Math 20000 with either a minimum grade of B-, statistics major, or current enrollment
in prerequisite course.</li>
	</ul>
	Contact me by email if you have questions about whether this course is appropriate for you.</br></p>      
      
      <h4><b>Course Policies</b></h4>

      <p><b>Gradescope:</b> This course will use <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>, an online platform for grading exams and homework.  Students registered for the course on the first day of class should have received an email to sign up for Gradescope.  If you are enrolled in the course and do not have an account, email me immediately.  A few notes about Gradescope:

	<ul>
	  <li>All evaluation is done by humans (the TAs and me).  You are not being graded by a computer.</li>
	  <li>You will be able to view your graded papers on the Gradescope website.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p><b>Lectures:</b> Lectures will be synchronous on Zoom during the scheduled lecture time.
        There is an expectation that students in this course will be actively engaged while on Zoom.</p>
      
      <p><b>Homework:</b> There will be weekly written homeworks due Monday. Homeworks are posted <a href="#hw">here</a>. Homework should be submitted electronically via Gradescope before the start of class.  To submit on Gradescope, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMPoby5g_nE">this Youtube video</a> or follow the steps below:

	<ol>
	  <li>Produce a legible .pdf file containing your complete solutions to each problem.  This does <b>not</b> mean you must type up your solutions; instead, you may scan your handwritten solutions.  Some guidelines for scanning are:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Gradescope <a href="http://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf">recommends</a> several free mobile/tablet apps which allow you to turn photos into multi-page PDFs.  I also suggest using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/mobile/document-scanning">Dropbox mobile scanning</a>.</li>
	      <li>Be sure to <b>preview</b> your scan and make sure it is legible before uploading to Gradescope.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Upload the .pdf file to Gradescope by the submission deadline (11:30am Monday).</li>
	  <li>Select the page(s) that contain the solution to each of the assigned problems. <b>Failure to do this step will mean that some or all of your problems will not be graded!</b></li>
	</ol>
	Email me or the TAs if you have trouble with the submission procedure.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>Exams:</b> There will be one midterm exam and a cumulative final exam according to the following schedule.
        <ul>
          <li>Midterm: Monday, October 26. Practice exam: (<a href="exams/prac.midterm.pdf">.pdf</a>) Practice exam solutions: (<a href="exams/prac.midterm.sol.pdf">.pdf</a>)</li>
          <li>Final Examination: December 9-11 as scheduled by the registrar.</li>
        </ul>
        The use of notes, textbooks, or electronic devices will not be allowed during exams. No make-up exams will be offered without a letter from the dean or a doctorâ€™s note.  No make-ups are possible for the final exam.</p>

      <p><b>Grading:</b> The final course grade will be determined according to the maximum of the two following computations:
        <ul>
          <li>(20% Homework) + (80% Final)</li>
          <li>(20% Homework) + (30% Midterm) + (50% Final)</li>
        </ul>
        The lowest homework scores will be dropped to accommodate illness and other unforeseen circumstances.  Late homework will not be accepted.
      </p>

      <p><b>Collaboration and Academic Integrity:</b> I encourage you to work together on homework!  For written homework, you must write your solutions alone and <b>understand what you write</b>.  When submitting your homework, you should cite any sources you used (in print, online, or human) other than the textbook and myself.</p>

equitable access to our academic
programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of
academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable
