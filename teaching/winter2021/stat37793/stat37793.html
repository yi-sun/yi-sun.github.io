      </p>

      <h4><b>Overview and prerequisites</b></h4>

      <p><b>Description:</b> This course will explore modern approaches to optimization, data augmentation, and
        domain shift for deep neural networks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.
        Participation will require independent investigation with PyTorch as well as paper presentations.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> STAT 37601/CMSC 25025, STAT 37710/CMSC 35400, or equivalent. Contact me by
        email if you have questions about whether this course is appropriate for you.</br></p>      
      
      <h4><b>Course Policies</b></h4>

      <p><b>Lectures:</b> The course will begin with 3 weeks of lectures on modern approaches to
        initialization, optimization, and generalization for deep networks.</p>

      <p><b>Projects:</b> Students will be divided into groups to complete projects on
        the 6 topics below.  Each student will be in a group for 2 projects.  Papers and
        references for each topic are <a href="projects.pdf">here</a>.
        <ul>
          <li>Week of Feb. 1: Batch normalization</li>
          <li>Week of Feb. 8: Evolution of the NTK</li>
          <li>Week of Feb. 15: Implicit bias of SGD</li>
          <li>Week of Feb. 22: Data augmentation</li>
          <li>Week of Mar. 1: Average-case robustness</li>
          <li>Week of Mar. 8: Adversarial robustness</li>
        </ul>
        Each group will read papers assigned for each of these topics, (optionally) search the literature
        for more recent papers on the subject, and finally choose a paper to base a project on.  They
        will give presentations on a pre-approved subset of the papers in the first session of each week and present the results of their
        experiments in the second session of each week.<br/><br/>

        Groups should submit the following by email:
        <ul>
          <li><b>2 weeks</b> before the first presentation: A project proposal and experimental plan.  The project
            should either (1) reproduce the main result of a paper on a manageable dataset and attempt a small
            variation, or (2) investigate an original question suggested by the topic.  If you attempt a project
            of type (2), please clear your plan with me on Slack in advance.</li>
          <li><b>1 week</b> before the first presentation: A 2-3 page progress report on the experimental results so far. </li>
          <li><b>End of week</b> of the presentation: A 5-10 page project report. </li>
        </ul>
        You should also feel free to discuss the project with me over Slack at any time.
      </p>

      <p><b>Compute:</b> Please use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=OwuxHmxllTwN">Google
          Colab</a> for compute.  Here are a few additional resources:
        <ul>
          <li>I recommend using <a href="https://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a> to track and share training runs.</li>
          <li>See <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zkoPdBZWUMsTpvA35ShVNAP0QcRsPUjf">here</a> for a guide
            to using PyTorch and W&B to train a model on Colab.</li>
          <li>The course will use PyTorch.  You may use TensorFlow if you already know it, but I advise most students
            to use PyTorch.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p><b>Grading:</b> The course will be graded pass/fail based on project work. </p>

      <p><b>Accessibility:</b> The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring
equitable access to our academic
programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of
academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable
accommodation(s) to participate fully in this course should follow the procedures

ensure that your accommodations can be implemented. Please meet with me to discuss
your access needs in this class after you have completed the SDS procedures for
requesting accommodations.  Information on the SDS registration
process is available <a href="https://disabilities.uchicago.edu">here</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Recording:</b> The Recording and Deletion Policies for the current academic year can be
        found in the Student Manual under Petitions, Audio, and Video Recording on Campus.
        <ul>
          <li>Do not record, share, or disseminate any course sessions, videos, transcripts, audio, or chats.</li>
          <li>Do not share links for the course to those not currently enrolled.</li>
          <li>Zoom cloud recordings will be automatically deleted 90 days after the completion of the recording.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p><b>COVID-19:</b> Students who have been exposed to or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should
        contact <a href="https://wellness.uchicago.edu">UChicago Student Wellness</a> immediately to be tested,
        and reach out to their area Dean of Students to request accommodations for classes until:
        <ul>
          <li>At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and;</li>
          <li>At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of
            fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms
            (cough, shortness of breath).</li>
        </ul></p>        
      
      <p><b>Getting help:</b> Please come to office hours, email me, or chat on Slack if you
        would like to discuss the course material.</p>
