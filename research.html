        My research interests are in representation theory and integrable systems and applications
        to random matrices and probability.  I have also worked on
        applications of stochastic processes to network methods in
        machine learning and axiomatic foundations of cost-sharing methods in economics.

	    We study the outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors in variance components estimates for high-dimensional mixed effects linear models using a free probability approach. We quantify the almost-sure limits of these eigenvalues and their eigenvector alignments, under a general bulk-plus-spikes assumption for the population covariances of the random effects, extending previous results in the identity-plus-spikes setting. Our analysis develops two tools in free probability and random matrix theory which are of independent interest&mdash;strong asymptotic freeness of GOE and deterministic matrices, and a method of proving deterministic anisotropic approximations to resolvents using free deterministic equivalents. Statistically, our results quantify bias and aliasing effects for the leading principal components of variance components estimates in modern high-dimensional applications.

We study global fluctuations for singular values of \(M\)-fold products of several right-unitarily invariant \(N \times N\) random matrix ensembles.  As \(N \to \infty\), we show the fluctuations of their height functions converge to an explicit Gaussian field, which is log-correlated for \(M\) fixed and has a white noise component for \(M \to \infty\) jointly with \(N\).  Our technique centers on the study of the multivariate Bessel generating functions of these spectral measures, for which we prove a central limit theorem for global fluctuations via certain conditions on the generating functions.  We apply our approach to a number of ensembles, including rectangular Ginibre matrices, truncated Haar-random unitary matrices, and right-unitarily invariant matrices with fixed singular values, using a detailed asymptotic analysis of multivariate Bessel functions to verify the necessary conditions.

Our techniques extend and generalize the framework of intertwining diffusions developed by Pal-Shkolnikov.

	  <span class="abstract">
	    Considerable work on adversarial defense has studied robustness to a fixed, known family of adversarial distortions, most frequently L_p-bounded distortions. In reality, the specific form of attack will rarely be known and adversaries are free to employ distortions outside of any fixed set. The present work advocates measuring robustness against this much broader range of unforeseen attacks---attacks whose precise form is not known when designing a defense.<br/><br/>
We propose a methodology for evaluating a defense against a diverse range of distortion types together with a summary metric UAR that measures the Unforeseen Attack Robustness against a distortion. We construct novel JPEG, Fog, Gabor, and Snow adversarial attacks to simulate unforeseen adversaries and perform a careful study of adversarial robustness against these and existing distortion types. We find that evaluation against existing L_p attacks yields highly correlated information that may not generalize to other attacks and identify a set of 4 attacks that yields more diverse information. We further find that adversarial training against either one or multiple distortions, including our novel ones, does not confer robustness to unforeseen distortions. These results underscore the need to study robustness against unforeseen distortions and provide a starting point for doing so.

        the associated density \(p(x_i)\) given only the directed graph and \(d\). 
        We show that consistent recovery is possible up to isometric scaling
        when the vertex degree is at least \(\omega(n^{2/(2+d)}\log(n)^{d/(d+2)})\). Our
        estimator is based on a careful characterization of a random walk over
        the directed graph and the associated continuum limit. As an
        algorithm, it resembles the PageRank centrality metric. We demonstrate
        empirically that the estimator performs well on simulated examples as
        well as on real-world co-purchasing graphs even with a small number of
        points and degree scaling as low as \(\log(n)\).

        We study the attribution problem, that is, the problem of attributing a
        change in the value of a characteristic function to its independent
        variables. We make three contributions. First, we propose a
        formalization of the problem based on a standard cost sharing
        model. Second, we show that there is a unique attribution method that
        satisfies Dummy, Additivity, Conditional Nonnegativity, Affine Scale
        Invariance, and Anonymity for all characteristic functions that are
        the sum of a multilinear function and an additive function. We term
        this the Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method. Conversely, we show that such a
        uniqueness result does not hold for characteristic functions outside
        this class. Third, we study multilinear characteristic functions in
        detail; we describe a computationally efficient implementation of the
        Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method and discuss practical applications to
        pay-per-click advertising and portfolio analysis.</span></span></p>
