	  <span class="abstract">
            Motivated by applications to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we study several problems of function estimation in a low SNR regime, where samples are observed under random rotations of the function domain. In a general framework of group orbit estimation with linear projection, we describe a stratification of the Fisher information eigenvalues according to a sequence of transcendence degrees in the invariant algebra, and relate critical points of the log-likelihood landscape to a sequence of method-of-moments optimization problems. This extends previous results for a discrete rotation group without projection.<br/><br/>
            
            We then compute these transcendence degrees and the forms of these moment optimization problems for several examples of function estimation under SO(2) and SO(3) rotations, including a simplified model of cryo-EM as introduced by Bandeira, Blum-Smith, Kileel, Perry, Weed, and Wein. For several of these examples, we affirmatively resolve numerical conjectures that 3rd-order moments are sufficient to locally identify a generic signal up to its rotational orbit.<br/><br/>
            
For low-dimensional approximations of the electric potential maps of two small protein molecules, we empirically verify that the noise-scalings of the Fisher information eigenvalues conform with these theoretical predictions over a range of SNR, in a model of SO(3) rotations without projection.

	  <span class="abstract">
	    We study the non-convex optimization landscape for maximum likelihood estimation in the discrete orbit recovery model with Gaussian noise. This model is motivated by applications in molecular microscopy and image processing, where each measurement of an unknown object is subject to an independent random rotation from a rotational group. Equivalently, it is a Gaussian mixture model where the mixture centers belong to a group orbit.<br/><br/>
We show that fundamental properties of the likelihood landscape depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the group structure. At low noise, this landscape is "benign" for any discrete group, possessing no spurious local optima and only strict saddle points. At high noise, this landscape may develop spurious local optima, depending on the specific group. We discuss several positive and negative examples, and provide a general condition that ensures a globally benign landscape. For cyclic permutations of coordinates on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (multi-reference alignment), there may be spurious local optima when \(d\geq 6\), and we establish a correspondence between these local optima and those of a surrogate function of the phase variables in the Fourier domain.<br/><br/>
We show that the Fisher information matrix transitions from resembling that of a single Gaussian in low noise to having a graded eigenvalue structure in high noise, which is determined by the graded algebra of invariant polynomials under the group action. In a local neighborhood of the true object, the likelihood landscape is strongly convex in a reparametrized system of variables given by a transcendence basis of this polynomial algebra. We discuss implications for optimization algorithms, including slow convergence of expectation-maximization, and possible advantages of momentum-based acceleration and variable reparametrization for first- and second-order descent methods.

	  <span class="abstract">
	    Virasoro conformal blocks are a family of important functions defined as power series via the Virasoro algebra. They are a fundamental input to the conformal bootstrap program for 2D conformal
	    field theory (CFT) and are closely related to four dimensional supersymmetric gauge
        theory through the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa correspondence. The present work provides a
        probabilistic construction of the 1-point toric Virasoro conformal block for central change
        greater than 25. More precisely, we construct an analytic function using a probabilistic
        tool called Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) and prove that its power series expansion
        coincides with the 1-point toric Virasoro conformal block. The range \((25,\infty)\) of central charges
        corresponds to Liouville CFT, an important CFT originating from 2D quantum gravity and bosonic
        string theory. Our work reveals a new integrable structure underlying GMC and opens the door to
        the study of non-perturbative properties of Virasoro conformal blocks such as their analytic
        continuation and modular symmetry. Our proof combines an analysis of GMC with tools from CFT
        such as Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential equations, operator product expansions, and
        Dotsenko-Fateev type integrals.

Our analysis develops two tools in free probability and random matrix theory which are of independent interest&mdash;strong asymptotic freeness of GOE and deterministic matrices, and a method of proving deterministic anisotropic approximations to resolvents using free deterministic equivalents. Statistically, our results quantify bias and aliasing effects for the leading principal components of variance components estimates in modern high-dimensional applications.

We study global fluctuations for singular values of \(M\)-fold products of several right-unitarily invariant \(N \times N\) random matrix ensembles.  As \(N \to \infty\), we show the fluctuations of their height functions converge to an explicit Gaussian field, which is log-correlated for \(M\) fixed and has a white noise component for \(M \to \infty\) jointly with \(N\).  Our technique centers on the study of the multivariate Bessel generating functions of these spectral measures, for which we prove a central limit theorem for global fluctuations via certain conditions on the generating functions.  We apply our approach to a number of ensembles, including rectangular Ginibre matrices, truncated Haar-random unitary matrices, and right-unitarily invariant matrices with fixed singular values, using a detailed asymptotic analysis of multivariate Bessel functions to verify the necessary conditions.

Our results show that an aliasing phenomenon may occur in high dimensions, in which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the MANOVA estimate for one variance component may be influenced by the other components. We propose an alternative procedure for estimating the true principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors that asymptotically corrects for this aliasing problem.

            We define Laguerre and Jacobi analogues of the Warren process.

Our techniques extend and generalize the framework of intertwining diffusions developed by Pal-Shkolnikov.  One consequence is the construction of particle systems with local interactions whose fixed time distribution recovers the hard edge of random matrix theory. An appendix by Andrey Sarantsev establishes strong existence and uniqueness for solutions to SDER's satisfied by these processes.

        <b>Accelerating Approximate Aggregation Queries with Expensive Predicates</b>, VLDB 2021. (<a href="https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2341-kang.pdf">proceedings</a>)

	  <span class="abstract">
            Researchers and industry analysts are increasingly interested in computing aggregation queries over large, unstructured datasets with selective predicates that are computed using expensive deep neural networks (DNNs). As these DNNs are expensive and because many applications can tolerate approximate answers, analysts are interested in accelerating these queries via approximations. Unfortunately, standard approximate query processing techniques to accelerate such queries are not applicable because they assume the result of the predicates are available ahead of time. Furthermore, recent work using cheap approximations (i.e., proxies) do not support aggregation queries with predicates.<br/> <br/>
            
To accelerate aggregation queries with expensive predicates, we develop and analyze a query processing algorithm that leverages proxies (ABae). ABae must account for the key challenge that it may sample records that do not satisfy the predicate. To address this challenge, we first use the proxy to group records into strata so that records satisfying the predicate are ideally grouped into few strata. Given these strata, ABae uses pilot sampling and plugin estimates to sample according to the optimal allocation. We show that ABae converges at an optimal rate in a novel analysis of stratified sampling with draws that may not satisfy the predicate. We further show that ABae outperforms on baselines on six real-world datasets, reducing labeling costs by up to 2.3x.

	<span class="abs-non"><br/>
	  <span class="abstract">
            We present a theoretical framework recasting data augmentation as stochastic optimization for a sequence of time-varying proxy losses. This provides a unified approach to understanding techniques commonly thought of as data augmentation, including synthetic noise and label-preserving transformations, as well as more traditional ideas in stochastic optimization such as learning rate and batch size scheduling. We prove a time-varying Monro-Robbins theorem with rates of convergence which gives conditions on the learning rate and augmentation schedule under which augmented gradient descent converges. Special cases give provably good joint schedules for augmentation with additive noise, minibatch SGD, and minibatch SGD with noise.

	    Considerable work on adversarial defense has studied robustness to a fixed, known family of adversarial distortions, most frequently L_p-bounded distortions. In reality, the specific form of attack will rarely be known and adversaries are free to employ distortions outside of any fixed set. The present work advocates measuring robustness against this much broader range of unforeseen attacks---attacks whose precise form is not known when designing a defense.<br/><br/>
We propose a methodology for evaluating a defense against a diverse range of distortion types together with a summary metric UAR that measures the Unforeseen Attack Robustness against a distortion. We construct novel JPEG, Fog, Gabor, and Snow adversarial attacks to simulate unforeseen adversaries and perform a careful study of adversarial robustness against these and existing distortion types. We find that evaluation against existing L_p attacks yields highly correlated information that may not generalize to other attacks and identify a set of 4 attacks that yields more diverse information. We further find that adversarial training against either one or multiple distortions, including our novel ones, does not confer robustness to unforeseen distortions. These results underscore the need to study robustness against unforeseen distortions and provide a starting point for doing so.

	  <span class="abstract"> 
	    Large unweighted directed graphs are commonly used to capture relations
	    between entities. A fundamental problem in the analysis of such networks
	    is to properly define the similarity or dissimilarity between any two
	    vertices. Despite the significance of this problem, statistical
	    characterization of the proposed metrics has been limited.<br/><br/>
	    
	    We introduce and develop a class of techniques for analyzing random
	    walks on graphs using stochastic calculus. Using these techniques we
	    generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a
	    metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric
	    serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected
	    hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting
	    times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the
	    graph. We show that the LTHT is consistent with respect to the
	    underlying metric of a geometric graph, preserves clustering tendency,
	    and remains robust against random addition of non-geometric edges. Tests
	    on simulated and real-world data show that the LTHT matches theoretical
	    predictions and outperforms alternatives.

        We analyze directed, unweighted graphs obtained from \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\) by connecting
        vertex \(i\) to \(j\) iff \(|x_i−x_j| &lt; \varepsilon(x_i)\). Examples of such graphs include
        \(k\)-nearest neighbor graphs, where \(\varepsilon(x_i)\) varies from point to point,
        and, arguably, many real world graphs such as co-purchasing graphs. We
        ask whether we can recover the underlying Euclidean metric \(\varepsilon(x_i)\) and
        the associated density \(p(x_i)\) given only the directed graph and \(d\). 
        We show that consistent recovery is possible up to isometric scaling
        when the vertex degree is at least \(\omega(n^{2/(2+d)}\log(n)^{d/(d+2)})\). Our
        estimator is based on a careful characterization of a random walk over
        the directed graph and the associated continuum limit. As an
        algorithm, it resembles the PageRank centrality metric. We demonstrate
        empirically that the estimator performs well on simulated examples as
        well as on real-world co-purchasing graphs even with a small number of
        points and degree scaling as low as \(\log(n)\).

        We study the attribution problem, that is, the problem of attributing a
        change in the value of a characteristic function to its independent
        variables. We make three contributions. First, we propose a
        formalization of the problem based on a standard cost sharing
        model. Second, we show that there is a unique attribution method that
        satisfies Dummy, Additivity, Conditional Nonnegativity, Affine Scale
        Invariance, and Anonymity for all characteristic functions that are
        the sum of a multilinear function and an additive function. We term
        this the Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method. Conversely, we show that such a
        uniqueness result does not hold for characteristic functions outside
        this class. Third, we study multilinear characteristic functions in
        detail; we describe a computationally efficient implementation of the
